Here is a Swagger file example calling lambda functions as well as API proxying.

Some variables are in this file and will be replaced by the Makefile when calling `make api`:
  - %AWS_ACCOUNT%: Will replace this with your AWS_ACCOUNT environment variable. Create this variable if not present. 
  - %ORCH_CREDS%: One of our variable that we use. 

You can update the Makefile to edit, add or remove support for variables.
